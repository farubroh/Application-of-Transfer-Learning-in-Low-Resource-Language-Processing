# Application of Transfer Learning in Low-Resource Language Processing: A Case Study on Bangla Numeral Recognition

This repository contains the research paper, **"Application of Transfer Learning in Low-Resource Language Processing: A Case Study on Bangla Numeral Recognition"**, which was **accepted at the 2nd International Conference on Machine Intelligence and Emerging Technologies (MIET 2024)**.

## Overview
Speech recognition is a transformative field that converts human speech into text or other machine-readable formats. This study focuses on **Bangla Numeral Recognition from Speech Signal**, leveraging **Transfer Learning** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to address challenges in low-resource languages like Bangla. 

## Highlights
- Utilized a dataset comprising **19,906 individual audio files** for Bangla numerals (‘০-১৯৯’ or 0-199):
  - Numerals ‘০-৯৯’ (0-99) were sourced from a pre-existing dataset.
  - Numerals ‘১০১-১৯৯’ (101-199) were generated through augmentation, reducing dependency on raw data.
- Features **log Mel spectrograms** to represent complex audio structures for effective processing by CNNs.
- Employed **state-of-the-art CNN architectures**, including:
  - **DenseNet**
  - **ResNet**: Achieved the best performance with an accuracy of **95.58%**.
  - **VGG**
- Demonstrated significant potential for Bangla speech recognition systems, particularly in resource-constrained settings.



## Applications
- **Speech recognition systems** for low-resource languages.
- **Assistive technologies** for Bangla speakers.
- **Automated systems** for educational and administrative purposes.
